      <h4>General Rules</h4>
      <p>Every week, you pick a team to win. Points are received or deducted based on the result. The season is divided
        into two halves, you cannot pick the same team twice in a half. There are 19 matches in each half of the season,
        meaning one team goes unpicked each half.

      <p>There were 34 players last year and that number is expected to grow. If we reach 50 players this season, there will be an additional payout for the longest win streak of the season. If not, the payout structure percentages will remain the same. </p>
